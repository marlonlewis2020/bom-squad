# CAPSTONE Project for BOM Squad

## [ ----- GETTING STARTED ----- ]

For setting up your local repository and environment for the first time, follow the instructions below:
---

1. **Clone the repository** into your local project folder:  
    * >git clone [GITHUB](https://github.com/marlonlewis2020/bom-squad.git "Repository")


2. **CD into the cloned repo**:
    * `cd bom-squad`


3. **Create your venv**:
    * create venv (option 1): 
        * `python3 -m venv venv`
    * create venv (Python 3.4 and higher): 
        * `python -m venv venv`
4. **Activate your virtual environment**:
    * activate venv (WINDOWS): 
        * `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * activate venv (MAC): 
        * `source myvenv/bin/activate`
5. **Install the requirements**:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. **checkout the develop branch**: 
    * `git checkout develop`
    * Set upstream remote branch: 
        * `git push -u origin develop`

7. **Set Environmental path variable** so the project modules can be found and accessed:

    * Right click on This PC (My Computer)

    * Then select, Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables >

    * Add "C:\Python310" to the path variable 
        * (or it may be "C:\Python27", etc. In your C drive look for the Python folder name)

        * OR, Under system variables, create a new Variable called "PythonPath"
        
        * In this variable put 
            >C:\Python27\Lib;C:\Python27\DLLs;C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk;C:\path\to\project\root\folder‚Äù

8. **Create the Databases** in the environment you are connected to: 
    * In terminal, type "flask shell"
    * In the flask shell, type `db.create_all()`
    * type `exit()` to leave flask shell

9. **Setup .env file**
    * copy the contents of the .env.example file

    * create a new file in the "bom-squad/app" directory and name it .env

    * paste the contents from the .env.example file you copied

    * Generate a secret key using any available method, or open a python shell and run the following code:
    ```Python
    import secrets
    print(secrets.token_hex())
    ```

    * copy the secret code generated and paste it as the value for the SECRET_KEY variable in your newly created .env file

3. Checkout to master: 
    * `git checkout master`

4. Delete your local branch: 
    * `git branch -d BOM-1`

5. Create Pull Request: Go to github, go to your branch and click on pull requests
